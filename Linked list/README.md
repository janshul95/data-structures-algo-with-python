## Arrays
- Array is a swquential list of data. Being sequential means that each element is stored right after the previous on in memory
- If your array is really big and you are low on memory than it could be impossible to find large enpugh storage to fit your entire array
- Flip side of the coin is that arrays are very fast.
- Since each element is stored sequentially in continuous memory location. Each element of array can be accessed in O(1) time 
- There is no need to jump around b/w different memory locations
- This could be a very important point to take into consideration when choosing a list or an array for your real world application
